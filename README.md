# Password Strength Analyzer 🔐

The **Password Strength Analyzer** is a personal cybersecurity project developed to evaluate the strength of user passwords and promote secure authentication practices. The tool analyzes passwords using entropy calculations and rule-based validation to identify weak or commonly used passwords.

## Project Overview
This application checks password strength by combining **entropy-based analysis** with **regular expression (regex) rules**. It evaluates factors such as length, character variety, and predictable patterns. If a password is weak, the tool provides suggestions for creating a stronger and more secure alternative.

## Key Features
- Evaluates password strength using entropy calculations  
- Uses regex rules to detect weak patterns  
- Identifies commonly used or predictable passwords  
- Suggests stronger password alternatives  
- Simple and easy-to-use command-line interface  

## Technologies & Skills Used
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Concepts:** Cryptography Basics, Password Security  
- **Modules:** Regex, File Handling  

## Use Case
This project demonstrates a fundamental security concept used in authentication systems, access control mechanisms, and cybersecurity best practices. It helps users understand the importance of strong passwords in preventing unauthorized access.

## Future Enhancements
- Add password blacklist databases  
- Implement strength scoring levels  
- Integrate with real-time user authentication systems
